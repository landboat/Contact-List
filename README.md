# Contact List

Project from CIS 2500 to create an editable contact list using arrays and writing to binary files.

The intention of this assignment was to teach us about storing dynamic data in arrays, as well as to introduce the concept of linked lists. We had a choice between using an array or list implementation, and I chose the array to reduce the complexity of the pointers.
